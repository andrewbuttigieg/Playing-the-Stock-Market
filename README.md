This application is an answer to https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/40h9pd/20160111_challenge_249_easy_playing_the_stock/

To run the application, compile the file using GCC and run the output with space separated values for the stock input:

./a.out 19.35 19.30 18.88 18.93 18.95 19.03 19.00 18.97 18.97 18.98

This will generate the correct output of 18.88 (buy) and 19.03 (sell)
